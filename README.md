# surfnet

Surfnet is a python-based project to experiment and evaluate the performance of applying wavelet transforms and neural networks to predict stock market performance.

The project uses a morl wavelet and a single-layer LSTM with a sigmoid activation linked to a linear output to predict log-returns.

The main.py Python script contains all data analysis. Jupyter Notebooks are supplied to give users a easier understanding of underlying code.
